# zed-wakatime

This extension allows [ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net/), the free and open-source time tracker, to track what you are doing when using the [Zed](https://zed.dev/) editor.

Uses the [activitywatch-ls](https://github.com/sachk/aw-watcher-zed/tree/master/activitywatch-ls) to receive edit events from Zed and send hearbeats to an ActivityWatch server using the [](https://github.com/wakatime/wakatime-cli).

This plugin is heavily based on [the WakaTime plugin](https://github.com/wakatime/zed-wakatime) for Zed
